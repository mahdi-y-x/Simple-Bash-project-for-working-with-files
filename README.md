# My First Official GitHub Project! 

This is my very first official project uploaded to GitHub.  
I had very little activity before, but this marks the beginning of my journey. I aim to continue, grow, and upload better, bigger, and more practical projects in **Bash, JavaScript, Python**, and even penetration testing reports—or anything related to my field—here, as much as possible.  

This project took me about **a week** from start to upload, dealing with Git, GitHub, and various problems along the way!  

I know it sounds funny for a project that could take just an hour, but I was busy with other things and spent roughly **2 hours on it** throughout the week.  

Anyway, this is just the beginning. 😄
